Frontend/Timezone Converter setup instructions
Overview

This project is a Timezone Converter application built using modern web technologies to provide a fast and interactive user experience. The main functionalities of this application include converting the time from one timezone to another and selecting timezones via a search bar and slider present in every timezon component. The project uses the following technologies:

	Vite: A fast build tool and development server.
	React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
	Moment-Timezone: A library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates and times in different timezones.
	React-Icons: A collection of popular icons as React components.
	React-Beautiful-Dnd: A library for beautiful and accessible drag-and-drop interactions.
	Project Structure

Setup Instructions

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:
•	Node.js (v18.x or later)
•	npm (v6.x or later)

Step 1: Open the project
Opent the project in playpower-assignment/frontend-timezone-convertor

Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install the required Node.js dependencies by running:
npm install 

Step 3: Start the Development Server
Start the Vite development server by running:
npm run dev 
The server will start and the application will be available at http://localhost:5173.

Step 4: Build for Production
To build the project for production, run:
npm run build 
The build outputs will be placed in the dist directory.

Step 5: Preview the Production Build
To preview the production build, you can use the Vite preview command:
npm run preview 
This will start a local server to preview the production build.

Application Features
	Timezone Selector: Use the search bar to select the source and target timezones.
	Time Conversion: slide the time from the slider of a timezone component to see the converted time in the time input bar
	Drag and Drop: Use react-beautiful-dnd for intuitive drag-and-drop interactions in order to change the order of selected timezons
	Change the date from inputbar date:  use can change to date of timezone components
	Reverse the order of selected timezon: we can reverse the order of timezon by clicking the icon left of link icon at top right.
	Copy the link: we can copy the link of website by clicking on link icon at top right.


Additional Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
•	npm run dev: Starts the Vite development server.
•	npm run build: Builds the app for production.
•	npm run preview: Previews the production build locally.
•	npm run lint: Runs the linter to check for code quality issues.

Backend/student_assignment Setup instructions

Overview
This project is an Assignment Management System built using Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, and JWT for authentication. The system provides endpoints for user authentication, assignment creation, retrieval, update, deletion, and submission. The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and maintainability.

Setup Instructions

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following software installed:
Node.js (v12.x or later)
MySQL (v5.7 or later)
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/assignment-management-system.git
cd assignment-management-system

Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install the required Node.js dependencies by running:
npm install

Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:
PORT=3000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=root
DB_NAME=student_assignments
SECRET_KEY=djo98t*tu4*%&jfdlj$jdlgkjdfg8u9485udjgkdjgljkg4578438*dfhjkgsfh784eyt4*@^$tgyufty
Note: These variables configure the server port, database connection details, and the secret key for JWT authentication.

Step 4: Initialize the Database
Start your MySQL server and create the necessary database and tables by executing the SQL script provided. You can use a MySQL client or the command line:
mysql -u root -p < database/initializeDatabaseAndTables.sql
This command will prompt you for the MySQL root password and then execute the SQL script to set up the database and tables.

Step 5: Start the Server
Start the Node.js server by running:
node index.js or npm run dev
The server will start on the port specified in the .env file (default is 3000).

Step 6: Test the API
You can now test the API endpoints using tools like Postman or cURL. Ensure that you include the JWT token in the Authorization header for all authenticated routes except of /login route. For testing all enpoint we have postman file that can executes directly and will open all the routes in the postman. For understating how wll api endpoints works please refer to endpoint documentation file. 
Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
npm start: Starts the server in production mode.
npm run dev: Starts the server in development mode using nodemon for automatic restarts on file changes.

API Endpoints Documentation

Overview
This document provides detailed information on the API endpoints for the assignment management system. The API is built using Node.js and Express.js, with MySQL as the database and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. We have a postman api doucmation files that can execute directly in the postman.
The base URL for all endpoints is http://localhost:3000.
Authentication
All endpoints that modify or retrieve assignments require authentication via a JWT token. The token must be included in the Authorization header of the request in the following format:

Authorization:  <jwtToken> 

Endpoints
1. User Authentication
POST /api/login
Mock authentication service that accepts any username and password, and returns a JWT token for subsequent requests.
